# Othello
A python version of the game Othello or Reversi, using Tkinter. 

Totally in the works and done by an amateur who's trying to advance her logic skills, so there may totally be easier ways to do this, however this is what worked for me haha. 

STATUS:

othellow - creates board with four middle pieces, nothing else

othellow2 - creates board, places new pieces in alternating color but does not change colors as it should

reversi - creates board, places pieces, changes colors but does not always work (for example, changes colors it should not)

reversi2 - buggy, doesn't run.
